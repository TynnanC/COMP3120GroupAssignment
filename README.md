The application we propose to build will be for use by a personal trainer and their clients for training in the gym environment. The application would be mostly form based providing training plans and client profiles. Results could optionally be graphed over time but are probably out of scope initially. If all initial requirements are met, a Microsoft Excel API or maybe Apex charts in conjunction with mongodb could be included to allow for the graphing of progress. Optionally it could be used by multiple personal trainers and multiple clients.
The app will have progression built in, each session you can choose whether or not to accept the progression. Can be implemented using text inputs or check boxes, and use JavaScript to check if they are ticked/or exceed the exercise requirements and offer a progression (updating the data).
